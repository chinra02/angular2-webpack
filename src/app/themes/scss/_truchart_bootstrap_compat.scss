/*
  This file allows Twitter Bootstrap CSS to be included at the top level of the application
  without rewriting all the CSS of the pre-existing Truchart layout.



  IMPORTANT: This should be a temporary crutch.  As these screens are touched or replaced, they should be rewritten
             or modified to render correctly using Twitter Bootstrap.


  Truchart's layout assumes some certain CSS styles are in place to layout the page and the child
  components correctly.  Twitter Bootstrap alters some of those styles (applying styles to the body
  tag, or to "*") in a way such that Truchart components which are loaded into the outer window no
  longer look correct.

  Some of those basic styles which bootstrap modifies and affects Truchart are things like:
    - * { box-sizing: border-box }
    - body { line-height: 1.42857, font-family: Helvetica, font-size: 14px }

  Truchart components that are loaded into the outer window are:
    - Navigation/Main Menu
    - Modal dialog chrome
    - Some modal dialogs' contents
    - Patient Chart
    - Encounter edit
    - Worklist
    - Plan of Care

  ------------------------------

  The approach taken is to specifically target certain elements that are known to expect the pre-twitter-bootstrap
  styles and explicitly reset the styles for those components only.


  IMPORTANT: If it so happens that these compat workarounds hang around longer than temporarily, then a CSS class should
             be created for each workaround mixin, and those CSS classes should be added to the legacy screens' source
             code, based on which mixins were applied in this file's "SPECIFIC SCREEN TARGETTING" section. This will
             reduce overhead by eliminating duplicate instances of the mixin's contents.

/*
 * Each mixins tries to fix a specific issue related to adding bootstrap css to the outer window.
 * These mixins can be applied to a selector that targets a legacy screen that is loaded to the outer window..
 * For instance, You can target a specific tag by ID or Class that you know is a certain screen that does not
 * play nicely with bootstrap.  Then you can add the mixin using @import mixin-name.
 *
 * ex:
 * .my-screens-main-class { @include tc-bs-fix-box-size }
